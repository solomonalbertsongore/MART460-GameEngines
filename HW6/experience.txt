Overall this part of the expierence was fairly simple. It took me a bit to figure out the Minecraft mod but that's just 
because I'm inexpierenced in Minecraft. Salesforce can still be confusing for me, particularily the UI, but I'm starting
to get more comfortable with creating new objects and other things in it. Overall it was a pretty smooth week!
